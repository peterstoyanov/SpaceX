The solution consists of three projects:

-   **SpaceX.Client**:   Project with a controller that makes endpoints available as well as files for the front-end components and settings
-   **SpaceX.Service**:  A class library referenced by the API that is responsible for making calls to the SpaceX REST API and deserializing the response. As well as the logic for generating a PDF document.
-   **SpaceX.Models**: Contains properties from JSON as classes from API.
